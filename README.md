A results-oriented IT professional with **2+ years of hands-on experience** managing and securing network infrastructure. In my recent role, I configured routers, switches, and firewalls to support a 20-user office, **reducing network downtime by 30%** and **improving ticket resolution times by 25%**.

Now, with CCNA and Security+ certifications, I am deepening my expertise in enterprise networking and security, with the goal of moving into a dedicated Network Engineer or Security Analyst role.

### Certifications

| Certification | Issued |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** | June 2025 |
| **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** | December 2024 |
| **CompTIA A+** | September 2025 |
| **CCNP Enterprise** | *In Progress (Studying for 350-401 ENCOR)* |

### Featured Projects

*These are hands-on labs where I apply and test enterprise-grade networking and security concepts.*

### 1. Home Lab Enterprise Network Simulation
* Deployed a **pfSense firewall** to create a multi-layered network with separate VLANs for servers, workstations, and IoT devices.
* Configured **site-to-site & remote access VPNs** (OpenVPN/WireGuard) to simulate secure corporate connectivity.
* Integrated **Nagios** for network monitoring and **Wireshark** for deep packet inspection to analyze traffic and troubleshoot issues.
* Practiced incident response by simulating firewall breaches and testing rule changes to ensure security policies were effective.

### 2. Virtual Network Infrastructure (Cisco Packet Tracer)
* Designed and built a multi-site LAN/WAN topology using **IPv6, OSPF routing, and VLAN segmentation**.
* Implemented enterprise security policies using **ACLs, NAT, and router-based VPNs** to secure the network edge.
* Troubleshot and resolved complex routing and connectivity failures using Cisco debugging tools.
* Validated network resilience by implementing redundancy protocols and performing failover testing.

> **Fun Fact:** I’m naturally curious and once spent hours tracing a packet across a simulated network just to understand what broke, and I loved every second of it.
