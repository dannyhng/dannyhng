### About Me
I am a Network Engineer transitioning from traditional infrastructure management to **NetDevOps**. While I have a strong foundation in routing and switching (Cisco CLI), my focus is on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.  
I don't just study networking concepts; I build, break, and automate them in a production-grade hybrid environment. My goal is to bridge the gap between hardware operations and software-defined automation.

### Current Focus
* **Infrastructure:** Architecting hybrid environments using Proxmox VE and Bare Metal Linux.
* **Automation:** Replacing manual "ClickOps" with **Ansible** playbooks and **Python** scripts.
* **Security:** Implementing Zero Trust architecture using **Tailscale** and **pfSense**.

### Certifications

| Certification | Issued |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** | Issued June 2025 |
| **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** | Issued Dec 2024 |
| **CompTIA A+** | Issued Sept 2025 |
| **CCNP Enterprise** | *In Progress* |

### Featured Engineering Projects

#### 1. [Enterprise Hybrid Home Server Infrastructure](https://github.com/dannyhng/hybrid-homelab-infrastructure)
*A documentation of my journey architecting a production-grade network environment using modern DevOps principles.*
* **Architecture:** Designed a split-topology network separating Critical Infrastructure (Proxmox/pfSense) from Compute (Bare Metal Docker).
* **Automation:** Wrote **Ansible** playbooks to handle system patching and inventory management across heterogeneous OS types.
* **Observability:** Deployed a full monitoring stack (**Prometheus/Grafana**) via Docker Compose with raw kernel scraping via host networking.
* **Security:** Implemented **Zero Trust** remote access using Tailscale Subnet Routing to eliminate open WAN ports.

#### 2. [Virtual Network Infrastructure (Cisco Packet Tracer)](https://github.com/dannyhng/ccna-full-config-lab)
* Designed a multi-site LAN/WAN topology using **IPv6, OSPF routing, and VLAN segmentation**.
* Implemented enterprise security policies using **ACLs, NAT, and router-based VPNs** to secure the network edge.
* Validated network resilience by implementing redundancy protocols (HSRP/STP) and performing failover testing.
